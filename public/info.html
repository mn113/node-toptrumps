                <p class="text-justify">Top Trumps is a <em>turn-based card game</em> where you win rounds - and cards - by picking the category from the card in front of you which you think will beat your opponent's card.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">This online version uses cards generated from the CIA World Factbook - 243 countries and territories to be precise.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">You might win a round with Russia by playing its area, New Zealand by playing its longitude, or Vatican City by playing its population density. Get the idea?</p>
                <p class="text-justify">This game is written entirely in Javascript and was created for a 48-hour coding competition - although it took a little longer than that to get finished!</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Enjoy, and please send any feedback to <a href="mailto:toptrumps@politestudio.co.uk">toptrumps@politestudio.co.uk</a>.</p>
